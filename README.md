# iEatTacos

### Intro
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

iEatTacos is a restaurant-locator web app that allows users to quickly find and locate Yelp's Highest Rated taco spots near their current location.


### Intended User Flow
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
At landing, the user will immediately be asked to share their location with the browser and is encouraged to "Get Started" by either signing-in or signing-up.  Thereafter, the user is rerouted to the "Home" page which populates a Google map of their current location with markers representing the highest ranked taco shops according to Yelp.  A list of those shops also appends adjacent to the map allowing the user to "favorite" restaurants for future reference.
